Requirements : Java Runtime Environment (at least Java 7)
               and, if plugins required, Perl

DESCRIPTION
===========

A Java GUI that can be used to create datatool.sty databases in
datatool's internal format, which can be quickly imported into a
LaTeX document using \input (or datatool's \DTLloaddbtex). It can
also be used in batch mode to import data from SQL, CSV, XLS, ODS or
probsoln.sty datasets. Tools are available to sort or shuffle
or filter the database. The batch mode means that it can be
incorporated into the document build process and provides
a much faster build than using datatool's \DTLloaddb and 
\dtlsort commands.

INSTALL
=======

1. Ensure you have the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed
   (java.com/getjava).

2. Download and run datatooltk-installer.jar (either double-click on
   the jar file, if supported by your operating system, or run 
 
    java -jar datatooltk-installer.jar

   from a terminal).

If you want to use the datatooltk plugins you need to ensure
you have Perl installed.

The installer should create the following subdirectories in the
installation directory:

 - bin/ (contains scripts to run the application's .jar file)
 - doc/ (contains documentation if corresponding option was selected 
   during the installation)
 - lib/ (contains the application, datatooltk.jar, the libraries
   required by the application, see below, and the application
   resource files)
 - man/ (contains the man file datatooltk.1 if documentation option
   was selected during installation)
 - src/ (contains the source code, if the source option was selected
   during installation)
 - Uninstaller/ (contains the uninstaller)

Libraries
=========

The datatooltk.jar file in the lib directory is the main
application. The other .jar files are required libraries
provided by other sources. The texparserlib.jar library
is by the same author and is also GPL 3.0. The source code
is available from https://github.com/nlct/texparser

The other .jar files are third party libraries:

 - Java Help (https://javahelp.java.net/) GPL
 - Open CSV (http://opencsv.sourceforge.net/) Apache 2.0 License
 - MySQL connector (http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/) GPL
 - The Java Look and Feel Graphics Repository
   (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index-138612.html)
   JLFGR License
 - Apache POI (http://poi.apache.org/) Apache 2.0 License
 - jOpenDocument (http://www.jopendocument.org/) GPL

Source Code
===========

The source code is bundled in the CTAN upload as datatooltk-src.zip.
It can also be fetched from GitHub (https://github.com/nlct/datatooltk)
or extracted during the installation process if the source code
option is selected.

Compiling PDF Documentation
===========================

The documentation is contained within the src/doc/ subdirectory
of the source code. The documentation source is in XML format
src/doc/datatool-en.xml which is converted to both LaTeX and Java
HelpSet files to provide the standalone PDF documentation and 
the built-in help accessed while the application is running.

The conversion is performed by the Perl script included in
the src/doc/ directory. The relative paths need to be maintained
for the script to fetch the application resource files
(src/resources/dictionaries/*.prop) to supply the labels for menus 
and buttons and for LaTeX to find the image files (src/doc/images/).

Requirements: TeX, Perl.

Either (requires arara):

make -C src/doc datatooltk-en-GB.pdf

Or:

1. cd to the src/doc directory.

2. Run the createdatatooltkdocs Perl script to create the .tex file
   Either:

   createdatatooltkdocs en GB

   Or:

   createdatatooltkdocs en US

3. Run arara on the resulting .tex file. For example:

   arara datatooltk-en-GB

   Alternative run pdflatex, makeindex and makeglossaries as
   per the arara directives at the start of the .tex file

The man file datatooltk.1 can be created from src/doc/datatooltk.pod
using pod2man.
