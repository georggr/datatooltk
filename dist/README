Requirements : Java Runtime Environment (at least Java 7)
               and, if plugins required, Perl

DESCRIPTION
===========

A Java GUI that can be used to create datatool.sty databases in
datatool's internal format, which can be quickly imported into a
LaTeX document using \input (or datatool's \DTLloaddbtex). It can
also be used in batch mode to import data from SQL, CSV, XLS, ODS or
probsoln.sty datasets. Tools are available to sort or shuffle
or filter the database. The batch mode means that it can be
incorporated into the document build process and provides
a much faster build than using datatool's \DTLloaddb and 
\dtlsort commands.

INSTALL
=======

1. Ensure you have the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed
   (java.com/getjava).

2. Download and run datatooltk-installer.jar (either
double-click on the jar file or run 
"java -jar datatooltk-installer.jar" from a terminal).

If you want to use the datatooltk plugins you need to ensure
you have Perl installed.

Libraries
=========

The datatooltk.jar file in the lib directory is the main
application. The other .jar files are required libraries
provided by other sources. The texparserlib.jar library
is by the same author and is also GPL 3.0. The source code
is available from https://github.com/nlct/texparser

The other .jar files are third party libraries:

 - Java Help (https://javahelp.java.net/) GPL
 - Open CSV (http://opencsv.sourceforge.net/) Apache 2.0 License
 - MySQL connector (http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/) GPL
 - The Java Look and Feel Graphics Repository
   (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index-138612.html)
   JLFGR License

 - jOpenDocument (http://www.jopendocument.org/) GPL


Compiling PDF Documentation
===========================

The documentation is contained within the doc/ subdirectory
of the source code. The documentation source is in XML format
datatool-en.xml which is converted to both LaTeX and Java
HelpSet files to provide the standalone PDF documentation and 
the built-in help accessed while the application is running.

The conversion is performed by the Perl script included in
the doc directory. The relative paths need to be maintained
for the script to fetch the application resource files to
supply the labels for menus and buttons and for LaTeX to find
the image files.

Requirements: TeX, arara, Perl.

Either:

make -C src/doc datatooltk-en-GB.pdf

Or:

1. cd to the src/doc directory.

2. Run the createdatatooltkdocs Perl script to create the .tex file
   Either:

   createdatatooltkdocs en GB

   Or:

   createdatatooltkdocs en US

3. Run arara on the resulting .tex file. For example:

   arara datatooltk-en-GB

   Alternative run pdflatex, makeindex and makeglossaries as
   per the arara directives at the start of the .tex file
