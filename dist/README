DESCRIPTION
===========

A Java GUI that can be used to create datatool.sty databases in
datatool's internal format, which can be quickly imported into
a LaTeX document using \input. It can also be used in batch mode to
convert from SQL or CSV or import probsoln datasets. Tools are
available to sort or shuffle the database.

2. Download and run datatooltk-installer.jar (either
double-click on the jar file or run 
"java -jar datatooltk-installer.jar" from a terminal).

If you want to use the datatooltk plugins you need to ensure
you have Perl installed. An up-to-date TeX distribution is also
required if you want to import data from a probsoln dataset.
