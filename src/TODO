TODO List
=========

* Add shuffle function

* Implement currency data type

* Add template facility

* Add plugin module facility

* Add syntax highlighting to the cell editor?

* Image icons are just temporary for testing. These need to be
  changed to more interesting images.

  Most of the images are now from the Java Look & Feel Graphics
  Repository for the main GUI, but I can't work out how to
  reference them in Map.jhm

* Documentation needs finishing.

* Add stuff to bundle up the distribution, including installer
