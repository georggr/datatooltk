TODO List
=========

Lots of things!

* GUI is very primitive:

  - Need facility to add or remove columns/rows

  - Import SQL function needs a dialog box to enter the equivalent
    of the sql command line options --sqluser, --sqlpassword etc

  - Add a user preferences file so user can specify startup
    directory etc.

  - Add Undo/Redo mechanism

* Image icons are just temporary for testing. These need to be
  changed to more interesting images.

  Most of the images are now from the Java Look & Feel Graphics
  Repository for the main GUI, but I can't work out how to
  reference them in Map.jhm

* Documentation needs finishing.

* Add stuff to bundle up the distribution, including installer
