TODO List
=========

Lots of things!

* GUI is very primitive and currently only displays the contents of
  a database.

  - Make cells multilined to accommodate data that consists of 1 or
    more paragraphs of LaTeX code. (Blank lines will need to be
    converted to \DTLpar when saving.) See tests/test-para.csv

  - Need facility to edit header information (label, title and data
    type)

  - Need facility to add or remove columns/rows

  - Import SQL function needs a dialog box to enter the equivalent
    of the sql command line options --sqluser, --sqlpassword etc

  - Add a user preferences file so user can specify startup
    directory etc.

* Image icons are just temporary for testing. These need to be
  changed to more interesting images.

* Documentation needs finishing.

* Add stuff to bundle up the distribution, including installer
